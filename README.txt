INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS PROGRAM:

go to Evan\pandor and type:
 python app_threading.py

Sometimes the camera cooler needs to be turned off and on again for the 
it to initialize properly. It will say "DRV_SUCCESS" when it works.

Check the "keep cooler on" box to take multiple measurements without
turning the cooler off and on between each one.

Try not to interrupt the program when it's warming up, this can cause it
to freeze. If the program freezes, go to the command line and do a 
keyboard interrupt (CTRL-C)

For the motor to work, the program "StepperMotorArduinoCode.ino" needs
to be uploaded to the arduino.
